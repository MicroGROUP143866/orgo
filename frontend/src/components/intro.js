            We at ORGO strive to provide useful and accurate information along with support to people who are planning to accept organs and 
            blood transfusions as well as people for people who wish to become donors so as to give another person a second chance at life.
             We do this by providing information on the units of different types of blood available in various blood banks in bangalore 
             along with speciality treatment provided by certain hospitals in bangalore. We also accept registrations for people who wish 
             to become donors and send their details to various NGOs and government organizations.
