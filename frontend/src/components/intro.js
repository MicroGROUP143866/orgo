            We at ORGO strive to provide useful and accurate information along with support to people who are planning to accept organs and 
            to people who wish to become donors so as to give another person a second chance at life.
             We do this by providing awareness videos, email query support, and a list of available hospitals with organ donation availability 
             in and around Angamaly,Kerala.
